# LingXing API Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Async-First Design
All API operations MUST be asynchronous using Python's async/await pattern. The library should never block the event loop during network operations. Rationale: ERP systems handle high-volume data synchronization where concurrent requests are essential for performance.

### II. Domain Module Organization
API functionality MUST be organized by business domains (basic, sales, products, warehouse, ads, finance, etc.). Each domain MUST have its own API class, parameters, routes, and Pydantic schemas. Rationale: ERP systems have distinct business areas that require logical separation and independent evolution.

### III. Type Safety & Validation
All API parameters and responses MUST use Pydantic models for type validation and serialization. No raw dictionaries should be exposed to library users. Rationale: ERP data integrity is critical; type safety prevents runtime errors and ensures API contract compliance.

### IV. Rate Limiting Awareness
The library MUST handle API rate limits gracefully with configurable retry logic. Users should be able to choose between strict error handling or automatic retries with exponential backoff. Rationale: ERP systems frequently hit API limits during bulk synchronization operations.

### V. Authentication Security
All API authentication MUST use secure token management with automatic refresh capabilities. Credentials MUST never be logged or exposed in error messages. Rationale: ERP systems contain sensitive business data requiring robust security practices.

## API Design Standards

### VI. Consistent Error Handling
All API errors MUST inherit from a common base exception class with domain-specific error types. Error responses MUST include retry guidance when applicable. Rationale: ERP integration requires clear error diagnosis and recovery procedures.

### VII. Context Manager Support
All API classes MUST support both context manager (async with) and manual resource management patterns. Resources MUST be properly cleaned up to prevent connection leaks. Rationale: ERP processes run for extended periods where resource management is critical.

### VIII. Structured Data Output
API responses MUST be provided as structured Pydantic models with optional JSON serialization. Human-readable formatting should be available for debugging purposes. Rationale: ERP data requires both programmatic access and human-readable debugging capabilities.

## Development Workflow

### IX. Comprehensive Testing
Each domain module MUST have unit tests covering schema validation and integration tests covering actual API interactions. Mock responses should mirror real API structure. Rationale: ERP integration failures are costly; comprehensive testing prevents production issues.

### X. Documentation Completeness
All public methods MUST have complete docstrings with parameter types, return types, and example usage. API endpoint documentation should reference the official LingXing API documentation. Rationale: ERP developers need clear documentation for integration and troubleshooting.

## Governance

This constitution governs all development of the LingXing API client library. Amendments require:

1. **Documentation Update**: Changes must be documented with clear rationale
2. **Backward Compatibility Assessment**: Impact on existing users must be evaluated
3. **Test Coverage Update**: All changes must include corresponding test updates
4. **Version Bump Requirements**:
   - MAJOR: Breaking changes to public API or authentication patterns
   - MINOR: New domain modules or significant feature additions
   - PATCH: Bug fixes, documentation updates, or internal improvements

All pull requests must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity additions must be justified with specific ERP integration requirements that cannot be met simpler.
